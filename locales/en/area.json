  "section1": "Jabłonkowy Las occupies 20 hectares of idyllic, Warmian space. Our resort is located in a birch and pine forest, by a private lake, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Coming to us will provide everyone with close contact to nature, as well as peaceful and comfortable rest.",
  "section2": "Everyone will find something for themselves here. The bookworm will relax in a hammock or on a bench located right by the water. Families with children will actively spend time on a private beach or playground. For the more active, we have water equipment rentals, such as kayaks and boats, or beach volleyball. We also highly recommend hiking in our beautiful Warmia forests. Perhaps you will be able to spot other inhabitants of our area, such as cranes, herons, storks, ravens and hawks, sometimes deer and other animals.",
  "section3": "However, if you miss a big city, you can go on a trip to Olsztyn, 30 kilometers away from Jabłonkowy Las. The beautiful Old Town and the famous High Gate will delight everyone.",
  "section4": "In addition, the village of Grunwald, famous for the historical battle of 1410, when the Polish-Lithuanian army defeated the Teutonic Knights, is located 30 kilometers from our resort. Every year, on the Grunwald Field, a battle is staged with the participation of nearly 1,500 knights from Poland, Europe and even the world!",
