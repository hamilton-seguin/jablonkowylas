  Built with Gatsby Minimal TypeScript Starter
</h1>

 Jablonkowy Las is a website designed for a charming summer resort in the Masurian Lake District, showcasing its beauty and appeal to visitors. Built with Gatsby and GraphQL, the website leverages modern web technologies to deliver a fast and cost-efficient experience. The integration of i18next ensures seamless internationalization, making the site accessible to a broader audience.

As my first professional freelance project, I was responsible for the entire processâ€”from design to deployment. I collaborated with the client to transform their vision from Figma designs into a functional, responsive website. Along the way, I mastered Gatsby and GraphQL, appreciating GraphQLâ€™s ability to load only the necessary data for each page, optimizing performance and reducing costs. Learning i18next for translations was an equally rewarding experience, allowing me to expand the siteâ€™s accessibility to multiple languages.

2.  **Build the project.**

    You can either start or build the project locally

    ```shell
    # to start the app on local
